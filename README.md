# Stycker 

A place where developers can come together, like moths to a flame, to share their love of code! A place where you can find a project to contribute to, or create one of your own and watch as others flock to your side.

### ✨ Features

This project includes:

- Ability to create account and post projects
- Explore page where user can search for projects
- Ability to contribute to projects
- Post project page

### ⚡️ Getting Started

- Clone this project locally
- Install the dependencies by running `npm install `

- You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

- The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

- This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### 🏁 Start the App

- Start the server by running `npm run dev`

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
